Install script for the machine history part

When installed it can be accessed from:

http://machine-history-uberjar-machine-history.apps.dev.openshift.redhatkeynote.com/machines

This will likely all change in the near future, in particular:

- Native mode will be used instead of JVM for the actual production instance (requires postgres)
- The dev mode instances need to work a lot differently, the details of which are still being sorted out
