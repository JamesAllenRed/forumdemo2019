# Installing Syndesis on Demo Cluster

Just run:
```
./deploy.sh
```

## Rebuilding the images

If needed, images can be rebuilt from source:

- Camel K Runtime (no images, just needed libs): https://github.com/rhdemo/camel-k-runtime/blob/summit-2019/SUMMIT-2019.md
- Syndesis: https://github.com/rhdemo/syndesis/blob/summit-2019/SUMMIT-2019.md
- Camel K: https://github.com/rhdemo/camel-k/blob/summit-2019/SUMMIT-2019.md
